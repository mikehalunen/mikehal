<p>Every once in a while, I get this urge to send a mass email to the various people from whom I&#8217;ve learned something over the years. It would be a huge list, really. But most people wouldn&#8217;t have the faintest idea that they even helped me. In fact, most of them probably don&#8217;t know who I am. But I know who they are. Maybe not personally. But I know them from their code. And they taught me so much.</p>

<p>Maybe we should treat our code as a teaching tool. Everybody would win.</p>
